# Scrape

This repository contains scripts that i use for practicing web scraping.

## Scripts
The repo contains folders, within each folder there is a python script and a csv file(scraped data).
There are also stand-alone scripts, which demonstrates a simple principle.

* Simple: This [Script](https://github.com/EteimZ/Scrape/tree/main/Simple) is scraping a single page [website](https://scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/) to get data about all the countries in the world.
* ncdc: This [Script](https://github.com/EteimZ/Scrape/tree/main/Simple) is scraping **Nigeria Center for Disease Control's** [website](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/report/) to get tabular data on the latest covid-19 cases from each state in Nigeria.
